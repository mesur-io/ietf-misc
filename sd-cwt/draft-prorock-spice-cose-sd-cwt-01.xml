<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This document updates RFC8392, enabling the holder of a CWT to disclose or redact special claims marked disclosable by the issuer of a CWT.
The approach is modeled after SD-JWT, with changes to align with conventions from CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).
The ability to minimize disclosure of sensitive identity attributes, while demonstrating possession of key material and enabling a verifier to confirm the attributes have been unaltered by the issuer, is an important building block for many digital credential use cases.
This specification brings selective disclosure capabilities to CWT, enabling application profiles to impose additional security criteria beyond the minimum security requirements this specification requires.
Specific use cases are out of scope for this document.
However, feedback has been gathered from a wide range of stakeholders, some of which is reflected in the examples provided in the appendix.</t>

<t>This diagram captures the essential details necessary to issue and present an SD-CWT.
The parameters necessary to support these processes can be obtained using transports or protocols which are out of scope for this specification.
However the following guidance is generally recommended, regardless of protocol or transport.</t>

<ol spacing="compact">
<li>The issuer SHOULD confirm the holder controls all confirmation material before issuing credentials using the <tt>cnf</tt> claim.</li>
<li>To protect against replay attacks, the verifier SHOULD provide a nonce, and reject requests that do not include an acceptable an nonce (cnonce). This guidance can be ignored in cases where replay attacks are mitigated at another layer.</li>

<t>An SD-CWT is a CWT containing zero or more Digested Salted Disclosed Claim, and zero or more Salted Disclosed Claims.
The salt acts as a blinding factor, preventing a Verifier of an SD-CWT from learning claims that were not intentionally disclosed by a Holder.
A confirmation claim <tt>cnf (8)</tt> MUST be present in the CWT Claimset.
The <tt>sd_kbt</tt> MUST NOT be set by the Issuer, and MUST be set by the Holder, and is therefore marked optional in the following normative defintion of SD-CWT in CDDL:</t>

<t>As described above, an SD-CWT is a CWT with claims that require confirmation and support selective disclosure.
Confirmation mitigates risks associated with bearer token theft.
Note that new confirmation methods might be registered and used after this document is published.
Selective disclosure enables data minimization.
The mechanism through which map keys and array elements are disclosed is different, see SD-CWT Validation for details.
CWT Claims which are not explictly marked redactable by the Issuer are mandatory to disclose by the Holder.
A detailed privacy and security analysis of all mandatory and optionally disclosed claims SHOULD be performed prior to issuance.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sd-cwt-presentation"><name>SD-CWT Presentation</name>
<t>Presentations of an SD-CWT by a Holder to a Verifier require the Holder to issue an SD-CWT-KBT.</t>
<t>The SD-CWT-KBT is essential to assuring the Verifier:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>a) the Holder of the SD-CWT controls the confirmation method chosen by the Issuer.</li>
<li>b) the Holder's disclosures have not been tampered with since confirmation occured.</li>
</ul>
<t>The SD-CWT-KBT prevents an attacker from copying and pasting disclosures, or from adding or removing disclosures without detection.
Confirmation is established according to RFC 8747, using the <tt>cnf</tt> claim in the payload of the SD-CWT.
The Digested Salted Disclosed Claim are included in the <tt>sd_hash</tt> claim in the payload of the SD-CWT-KBT.</t>
<t>The proof of possession associated with the confirmation claim in an SD-CWT is called the SD-CWT-KBT.
As noted above, SD-CWT Issuance, <tt>sd_kbt</tt> SHALL be present in every presentation of an SD-CWT by a Holder to a Verifier.</t>

<t>Note that <tt>sd_hash</tt> is the digest using <tt>sd_alg</tt> of the <tt>sd_claims</tt> which are either Partially or Fully Redacted in the Presented SD-CWT.</t>
<t>The <tt>cnonce</tt> and <tt>audience</tt> are essential to assure the Verifier that the Holder is currently in control of the associated confirmation method, and that the holder intended to disclose the SD-CWT to the Verifier.</t>
<t>Note that <tt>cnonce</tt> is a <tt>bstr</tt> and MUST be treated as opaque to the Holder.</t>
<t>The details associated with these protocol parameters are out of scope for this document.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sd-cwt-validation"><name>SD-CWT Validation</name>
<t>The exact order of the following steps MAY be changed, as long as all checks are performed before deciding if an SD-CWT is valid.</t>
<t>First the Verifier must validate the SD-CWT as described in {{Section 7.2 of RFC 8392}}.</t>
<t>After validation, the SD-CWT-KBT MUST be extracted from the unprotected header, and validated as described in {{Section 7.2 of RFC 8392}}.</t>
<t>The Verifier MUST confirm the <tt>sd_hash</tt> claim of the validated SD-CWT-KBT matches the hash of the <tt>sd_claims</tt> member of the unprotected header, using the hash algorithm obtained from the validated <tt>sd_alg</tt> claim of the SD-CWT.</t>
<t>Next, the Verifier MUST extract and decode the disclosed claims from the <tt>sd_claims</tt> in the unprotected header.</t>
<t>The decoded <tt>sd_claims</tt> are converted to an intermediate data structure called a Digest To Disclosed Claim Map which is used to transform the Presented Disclosed Claimset, into a Validated Disclosed Claimset.</t>
<t>The Verifier MUST compute the hash of each <tt>salted-disclosed-claim</tt>, in order to match each disclosed value to each entry of the Presented Disclosed Claimset.</t>
<t>One possible concrete representation of the intermediate data structure for the Digest To Disclosed Claim Map could be:</t>

<sourcecode type="cddl-ish"><![CDATA[{
  &(digested-salted-disclosed-claim) => salted-disclosed-claim
}
]]>
</sourcecode>
<t>The Verifier constructs an empty cbor map called the Validated Disclosed Claimset, and initializes it with all mandatory to disclose claims from the verified Presented Disclosed Claimset.</t>
<t>Next the Verifier performs a breadth first or depth first traversal of the Presented Disclosed Claimset, Validated Disclosed Claimset, using the Digest To Disclosed Claim Map to insert claims into the Validated Disclosed Claimset when they appear in the Presented Disclosed Claimset.
By performing these steps, the recipient can cryptographically verify the integrity of the protected claims and verify they have not been tampered with.
If there remain unused Digest To Disclosed Claim Map at the end of this procedure the SD-CWT MUST be considered invalid, as if the siganture had failed to verify.
Otherwise the SD-CWT is considered valid, and the Validated Disclosed Claimset is now a CWT Claimset with no claims marked for redaction.
Further validation logic can be applied to the Validated Disclosed Claimset, as it might normally be applied to a validated CWT claimset.</t>

<section anchor="credential-types"><name>Credential Types</name>
<t>This specification defines the CWT claim vct (for verifiable credential type). The vct value MUST be a case-sensitive StringOrURI (see [RFC7519]) value serving as an identifier for the type of the SD-CWT claimset. The vct value MUST be a Collision-Resistant Name as defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].</t>
<t>This claim is defined COSE based verifiable credentials, similar to the JOSE based verifiable credentials described in Section 3.2.2.1.1 of SD-JWT-VC.</t>
<t>Profiles built on this specifiation are also encouraged to use more specific media types, as described in <eref target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter/">draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter</eref>.</t>

<section anchor="implementation-status"><name>Implementation Status</name>
<t>Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section as well as references to {{BCP205}} before AUTH48.</t>
<t>This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in {{BCP205}}.
The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>
<t>According to {{BCP205}}, &quot;this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit&quot;.</t>

<t>Description: An open source implementation of this draft.</t>
<t>Maturity: Prototype</t>
<t>Coverage: The current version ('main') implements functionality similar to that described in this document, and will be revised, with breaking changes to support the generation of example data to support this specification.</t>
<t>License: Apache-2.0</t>
<t>Implementation Experience: No interop testing has been done yet. The code works as proof of concept, but is not yet production ready.</t>
