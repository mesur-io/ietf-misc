.# Abstract

This document describes a data minimization technique for use with CBOR Web Token (CWT) [@!RFC8392].
The approach is based on SD-JWT [@?I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt], with changes to align with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (cose).
This document updates RFC8392.

# Notational Conventions

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**",
"**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

# Terminology

The terminology used in this document is inherited from RFC8392, RFC9052 and RFC9053.

This document defines the following new terms related to concepts originally described in SD-JWT.

SD-CWT (Selective Disclosure CBOR Web Token (CWT))
: A CWT equivalent of an SD-JWT. Unlike SD-JWT, SD-CWT is not a new token type, it is a profile of CWT. This is the CWT equivalent of application/sd-jwt.

Selective Disclosure Key Binding Token
: A CWT used to demonstrate possession of a confirmation method, associated to an SD-CWT. This is the CWT counterpart to application/kb+jwt. The key binding token is included in the `sd_kwt` claim in the unprotected header of SD-CWT presentations.

Disclosures
: The salted claims disclosed via an SD-CWT. They are included in the `sd_claims` array in the unprotected header.

Redacted keys
: The hashes of claims redacted from a map data structure.

Redacted elements
: The hashes of elements redacted from an array data structure. 

presented_sd_claims
: The CBOR map containing zero or more disclosable claims.

validated_presented_sd_claims
: The CBOR map containing all mandatory to disclose claims signed by the issuer, all selectively disclosed claims presented by the holder, and ommiting all instances of redacted_keys and redacted_element claims that are present in the original sd_cwt.

## Introduction

This document updates RFC8392, enabling the holder of a CWT to disclose or redact special claims marked disclosable by the issuer of a CWT.
The approach is modeled after SD-JWT, with changes to align with conventions from CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). 

The ability to minimize disclosure of sensitive identity attributes, while demonstrating possession of key material and enabling a verifier to confirm the attributes have been unaltered by the issuer, is an important building block for many digital credential use cases.

The approach described in this specification is not new. SD-JWT was modeled after mDoc, both of which enable similar capabilities.
This specification brings selective disclosure capabilities to CWT, enabling application profiles to impose additional security criteria beyond the minimum security requirements this specification requires.

Specific use cases are out of scope for this document.
However, feedback has been gathered from a wide range of stakeholders, some of which is reflected in the examples provided in the appendix.

This diagram captures the essential details necessary to issue and present an SD-CWT.
The parameters necessary to support these processes can be obtained using transports or protocols which are out of scope for this specification.
However the following guidance is generally recommended, regardless of protocol or transport.

1. The issuer SHOULD confirm the holder controls all confirmation material before issuing credentials using the `cnf` claim.
2. To protect against replay attacks,  the verifier SHOULD provide a nonce, and reject requests that do not include an acceptable an nonce (cnonce). This guidance can be ignored in cases where replay attacks are mitigated as another layer.

## Creating an SD-CWT

SD-CWT is modeled after SD-JWT, with adjustments to align with conventions in CBOR and COSE.

An SD-CWT is a CWT containing the hash digest (the "blinded claim hash") of each blinded claim, and optionally the salted claim values (and often claim names) for the values that are actually disclosed.

A Holder key binding CWT (see next section) MUST be present in a `sd_kbt` claim in the unprotected header when presenting an SD-CWT to a Verifier.

There does not exist a concept of "SD-CWT without key binding".

The following informative CDDL is provided.

Please note this example contains claims for demonstration of the disclosure syntax, such as `swversion`.

`sd_kbt` is marked optional because it is not present after issuance, however is MUST be present in all subsequent presentations of the sd-cwt.

``` cddl
sd-cwt = [
  protected,
  unprotected: {
    ?(sd_claims: TBD): bstr .cbor [ + claim-pair],
    ?(sd_kbt: TBD): bstr .cbor sd-cwt-kbt,
  },
  payload :  bstr .cbor {
    &(iss: 1) => tstr, ; "https://issuer.example"
    &(sub: 2) => tstr, ; "https://device.example"
    &(aud: 3) => tstr, ; "https://verifier.example"
    &(exp: 4) => int,  ; 1883000000
    &(nbf: 5) => int,  ; 1683000000
    &(iat: 6) => int,  ; 1683000000
    &(cnf: 8) => sd-cwt-cnf,  ; 1683000000

    ; sd-cwt new claims
    &(sd_alg: TBD) => int,            ; -16 for sha-256
    &(redacted_keys: TBD) => [ bstr ] ; redacted map key
    &(swversion: 271) => [              ; example array
      ...,
      {
        &(redacted_element: TBD) => bstr ; redacted array element
      }
      ...
    ]      
  }
  signature : bstr,
]
```

Disclosures are structured as a "sd-cwt-claim-pair" with a 32 bit salt, and the byte string of the disclosed value.

``` cddl
sd-cwt-claim-pair = [
  ; The RECOMMENDED minimum length 
  ; of the randomly-generated portion of the salt is 128 bits
  uint .size 16,  
  bstr           ; disclosed value
]
```

## Creating a Key Binding Token

A Key Binding Token is used to assure the Verifier that a) the Holder of the parent SD-CWT is in possession of the private key it used to request that SD-CWT from the Issuer ("confirmation"), and b) the list of disclosures included by the Holder were not tampered with. Holder Key Binding prevents an attacker from copying and pasting disclosures, or from adding or removing disclosures without detection. 

Confirmation is established according to RFC 8747, using the `cnf` claim in the payload of the KBT. A hash of the list of presented disclosure hashes is included in the `sd_hash` claim in the payload of the KBT.

The following informative CDDL is provided, however new confirmation methods might be registered and used after this document is published.

``` cddl
sd-cwt-cnf = COSE_Key / Encrypted_COSE_Key / kid
```

The proof of possession associated with the confirmation claim in an SD-CWT is called the SD-CWT-KBT.
As noted above, this token MUST be present in presentations of the SD-CWT and MUST NOT be present in the issued form of the SD-CWT which is first delivered from an issuer to a client.

``` cddl
sd-cwt-kbt = [
  protected: bstr .cbor { 
    &(alg: 1) => int  ; CWT algorithm
    &(typ: 16) => int ; Explicit type according to draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter
  },
  unprotected: {},
  payload : bstr .cbor {
    &(cnonce: 39) => bstr,   ; e0a156bb3f
    &(aud: 3) => tstr, ; "https://verifier.example"
    &(iat: 6) => int,  ; 1683000000
    &(sd_hash: TBD) => bstr, ; f0e4c2f76c589...61b1816e13b

    ?(exp: 4) => int,  ; 1883000000
    ?(nbf: 5) => int,  ; 1683000000

    ; additional CWT claims are allowed.
  }
  signature : bstr,
]
```

## Validating an SD-CWT

The exact order of the following steps MAY be changed, as long as all checks are performed before deciding if an SD-CWT is valid.

First the verifier must validate the SD-CWT as described in {{Section 7.2 of RFC 8392}}.

After validation, the SD-CWT-KBT MUST be extracted from the unprotected header, and validated as described in {{Section 7.2 of RFC 8392}}.

The verifier MUST confirm the `sd_hash` claim of the validated SD-CWT-KBT matches the hash of the `sd_claims` member of the unprotected header, using the hash algorithm obtained from the validated `sd_alg` claim of the SD-CWT.

Next, the verifier MUST extract and decode the disclosed claims from the `sd_claims` in the unprotected header.

The decoded `sd_claims` are converted to an intermediate data structure called `presented_sd_claims` which is used to transform the presented SD-CWT claimset, into a validated SD-CWT claimset containing no redaction claims.

One possible concrete representation of the intermediate data structure `presented_sd_claims` could be:

``` cddl-ish
{
  &(digest_of_salt_and_disclosure: bstr) => sd-cwt-claim-pair-disclosed-value
}
```

The verifier MUST compute the hash of the sd-cwt-claim-pair, in order to match the disclosed value to redacted claims in the SD-CWT.

To verify an SD-CWT, the recipient extracts the protected CWT claims from the payload. 
These CWT claims contain hash digests of the original claim values combined with unique random salts.

By performing these steps, the recipient can cryptographically verify the integrity of the protected claims and verify they have not been tampered with or substituted after issuance by the trusted issuer. 
The disclosures provide the plaintext claim values for utilization by the recipient.

The algorithm for transorming the CWT Claimset mirrors the algorithm defined in SD-JWT.
The primary differences are that CBOR maps have replaced JSON Objects, and that CBOR labels (integers) have replaced the strings used by SD-JWT which are `_sd` and `...`.
This specification uses the term `validated_presented_sd_claims` to refer to the final CBOR map which is produced by subsituting disclosed values which are presented, and removing labels marked for redaction.

As described in SD-JWT, if there remain unused SD-CWT disclosures at the end of this procedure the SD-CWT MUST be considered invalid, as if the siganture had failed to verify.

# Security Considerations

Security considerations from COSE [@!RFC9052] and CWT [@!RFC8392] apply to this specificaton.

## Random Numbers

Each salt used to protect disclosed claims MUST be generated independently from the salts of other claims. The salts MUST be generated from a source of entropy that is acceptable to the issuer.
Poor choice of salts can lead to brute force attacks that can reveal redacted claims.
